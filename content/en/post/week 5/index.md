## April 21th - April 29th

## Week in Review. 21.04 - 29.04 - Almost Done!

What Happened:

Hello everyone! A lot of interesting things happened this week. Firstly, I've almost finished my exam session. I just have a couple more subjects to pass and some documents to get from the Dean's office. Secondly, I managed to have some fun on the weekend. My friends and I had a sleepover, ordered pizza, and watched a movie. I also visited two exhibitions â€“ one for a university requirement, and the other because I genuinely wanted to go. Just a little bit more, and I'll finish my first year!

Plans for Next Week:

I plan to pass all the remaining subjects and then get the necessary documents from the Dean's office. I will continue studying English. And since next week is the May holidays, I plan to go out for barbeque and do a lot of walking.

Conclusion:

The past week was challenging but interesting. Share in the comments what's new with you!
