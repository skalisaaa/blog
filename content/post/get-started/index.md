## Study

Last week wasn't very busy, but I did have to defend my lab works. It wasn't perfect, but I managed to do it. Also, soon there will be a series of tests, and this week I decided to start preparing. It's better to start early, and not study everything on the last night like last time :)

## Friends

How can I do without meeting with friends? Not a single week goes by without it, the previous one is no exception. This week I met with friends several times. We went to a cafe or to someone's home. It was fun and we shot a bunch of funny videos.

## Sports

This point has slightly sagged this week, but nevertheless, I visited the fitness center. Lately, I have especially liked Pilates, yoga and stretching. Next week I plan to devote more time to sports.

## Tv-shows

This week I watched new episodes of several series, I won't talk about all of them, although I would like to mention one series. The series "Univer. Young" was recently released. It's something like a continuation of the old "Univer". But in fact, this new season is far from being as funny, and it feels like the writers have forgotten how to joke. It was better before!

## Something else. 

I need to pass my exams early, and to do that I need the consent of all the teachers. It turns out that it's quite a quest to find everyone and ask them to sign. I didn't manage to do it completely this week, so I'll continue next week. I hope that it won't turn out that my application was written incorrectly!
