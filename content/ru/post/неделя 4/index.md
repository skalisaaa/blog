## Week in Review. May 6th - May 12th - Surviving Early Exams and Finding Balance

Introduction:

Hello everyone! It's time for my weekly update, and let me tell you, this past week has been a whirlwind! I'm currently pushing hard to complete my exams ahead of schedule, which has resulted in some seriously late nights. However, I've also made a conscious effort to maintain a semblance of balance amidst the chaos. Here's a glimpse into what I've been up to.

Key Accomplishments/Highlights:

â€¢  Early Exam Progress: The biggest highlight has definitely been making progress with my early exams. Iâ€™ve been consistently staying up until 3 AM each night, cramming and preparing for these assessments. It's definitely challenging, but Iâ€™m determined to get through it.
â€¢  Two Exams Down! I successfully completed and passed two exams this week! I'm now finished with History of Religions and the Foundations of Military Training. It's a huge weight off my shoulders and a great boost to my motivation.
â€¢  Finding Time for Nature: Despite the crazy workload, I managed to escape for two walks in the park. It was so refreshing to disconnect from the books and enjoy some fresh air and sunshine.
â€¢  Cultural Outing: I also made time to visit a local art exhibition. It was a wonderful opportunity to appreciate some creativity and get my mind off studying, even if just for a few hours.
â€¢  Language Practice Maintained: I've been diligently practicing both English and German, even with everything else going on. A little bit of language learning each day helps me stay sharp and keeps my mind engaged in something different.

Challenges/Setbacks:

â€¢  Exhaustion is Real: The constant late nights have definitely taken their toll. Iâ€™m feeling quite tired and have struggled to maintain focus at times.
â€¢  Time Management Struggles: Juggling study, relaxation, and language practice has been a real challenge. There's been a constant battle to prioritize and fit everything in.

Learnings/Insights:

â€¢  Prioritization is Key: Iâ€™ve learned that prioritizing tasks and focusing on the most important things is crucial for surviving periods of intense workload.
â€¢  Self-Care is Non-Negotiable: Even when Iâ€™m busy, I need to make time for activities that help me relax and recharge. Skipping those activities ultimately makes me less productive.
â€¢  Small Wins Keep Me Going: Even small accomplishments, like completing a practice question or learning a new German phrase, contribute to a sense of progress and keep me motivated.

Goals for Next Week:

â€¢  Finish at least one more exam: My goal is to complete at least one more exam and continue making progress towards my early exam completion.
â€¢  Improve Sleep Schedule (Even Slightly): I'm going to try to get to bed a little earlier each night, even if it's just by 30 minutes. Every little bit helps!
â€¢  Continue Language Practice: I'll continue dedicating time to both English and German, even if it's just for a short period each day.

Conclusion:

This week has been a rollercoaster of studying, exams, and a few moments of respite. Itâ€™s been tough, but Iâ€™m feeling positive about the progress I'm making. Thanks for reading! How do you cope with periods of intense pressure? Share your tips in the comments below!
