# Week in Review. April 13th, 2025 - April 20th, 2025

Introduction:

Hello everyone! Time for another weekly update. This post summarizes my key activities, learnings, and reflections from the past week (April 13th - April 20th). It's a great way to keep track of progress, identify areas for improvement, and share what I've been up to.

Key Accomplishments/Highlights:

â€¢  Project Milestone: Successfully completed the initial design phase for the "Starlight" project. We presented the mockups to the client and received positive feedback. Next steps are to begin development.
â€¢  Learned a New Skill: Spent time learning the basics of Docker. Completed an online course and started experimenting with small projects.
â€¢  Solved a Challenging Bug: Debugged a particularly tricky issue in the "Cosmos API". The root cause was a race condition in the database update logic. After thorough analysis and testing, I implemented a locking mechanism to resolve the issue.
â€¢  Improved Efficiency: Streamlined my workflow by implementing "Keyboard Maestro" macros. Found that it significantly improved my focus and productivity.

Challenges/Setbacks:

â€¢  Unexpected Delay: Experienced an unexpected delay in receiving feedback from a colleague on the "Integration Document". This impacted my schedule for "API Testing".
â€¢  Technical Difficulty: Ran into some technical difficulties with "Cloud Functions deployment scripts". Spent more time troubleshooting than anticipated.

Learnings/Insights:

â€¢  Importance of Clear Communication: The delay in feedback highlighted the importance of proactively communicating with team members and setting clear expectations by sending a reminder email early in the week, rather than closer to the deadline.
â€¢  The Value of Documentation: Spending time reading the documentation for "Kubernetes" saved me a significant amount of time in the long run and avoided potentially costly misconfigurations.

Goals for Next Week:

â€¢  Begin Development on "Starlight": Start implementing the designs for the "Starlight" project, focusing on the user authentication module.
â€¢  Continue Learning Docker: Deepen my understanding of Docker by building a multi-container application.
â€¢  Reach out to Maria for Feedback: Follow up with Maria to ensure timely feedback on the "Integration Document".

Conclusion:

Overall, it was a productive week with its share of challenges and successes. I'm looking forward to tackling next week's goals and continuing to learn and grow. Thanks for reading! What were your highlights from the past week? Share them in the comments below!
